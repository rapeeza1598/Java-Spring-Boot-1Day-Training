# Java Spring Boot 1-Day Training Repository

Welcome to the Java Spring Boot 1-Day Training repository! This repository contains materials and code examples for a one-day training session on Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building web applications and microservices.

## Contents

This repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **configuration**: This directory contains configuration files for Spring Boot applications. These files typically include settings related to application properties, logging, security, and more.

2. **entity**: In this directory, you will find entity classes that represent the domain model of your Spring Boot application. Entities are typically mapped to database tables and represent the data structure of your application.

3. **repository**: The repository directory contains classes responsible for database operations using Spring Data JPA. These classes provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for interacting with the database.

4. **service**: Here, you'll find service classes that contain the business logic of your Spring Boot application. Services orchestrate the interaction between controllers and repositories, implementing the application's core functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-Spring-Boot-1Day-Training.git
   ```

2. Explore the directories and files to understand the structure of the Spring Boot application.

3. Dive into each directory to examine the configuration, entities, repositories, and services provided as examples.

4. Modify and extend the codebase to suit your learning needs. Experiment with different configurations, entities, repositories, and services to deepen your understanding of Spring Boot.

5. Refer to the documentation and additional resources to enhance your knowledge of Spring Boot development.
